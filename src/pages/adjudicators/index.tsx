                  Originally from Saskatchewan, Lindsay Harpham is an accomplished Contemporary Artist, Dance Educator, Choreographer, and Adjudicator based out of Vancouver, BC. Lindsay has trained in Classical Ballet, Jazz, Tap, Lyrical, Contemporary, Modern, and Partnering and has completed her R.A.D teaching certification, and Bachelor of Kinesiology, which both greatly inform her teaching. Lindsay choreographs for both competitive and recreational studios throughout Canada and teaches master classes internationally for youth and adults.
                  
                  Her post-secondary dance training started at Harbour Dance Center in Vancouver and later, Toronto, where she completed The Conteur Academy’s diploma program. Since graduation, she has worked with companies such as Red Sky Performance, Larchaud Dance Project, Gadfly, ACE Dance Theatre, Nimii Project, Hit and Run Productions, Nickelodeon, and Remai Modern. Grateful to have experienced professional dance tours throughout Canada, the United States, Europe, and Australia, she searches for opportunities that feel comparably inspiring. Amongst her most notable moments, CINARS opening, Australia Joint Dance Congress, performances with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, have expanded her perception of what is possible as an artist.
                  
                  While pursuing professional dance, she graduated with a Bachelor of Kinesiology, which she combines with her dance experience through teaching injury prevention and cross-training seminars to dancers at SFU, Modus, and Source Dance Company. She currently works at the Performance Clinic at Ballet BC headquarters, working with dancers and other athletes. Lindsay most recently co-founded Wherewe Collective with fellow dancer and sister Denae Harpham, which runs a sleep-away dance camp in Saskatchewan for students and teachers. Lindsay brings her passion for art to each professional experience and hopes to always make a positive impact on the young aspiring artists she has the privilege of teaching and adjudicating.
